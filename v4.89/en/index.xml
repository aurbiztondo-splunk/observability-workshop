In order to simplify the workshop modules, a pre-configured AWS/EC2 instance is provided.
The instance is pre-configured with all the software required to deploy the Splunk OpenTelemetery Connector2 in Kubernetes, deploy a NGINX3 ReplicaSet4 and finally deploy a microservices based application which has been instrumented using OpenTelemetry to send metrics, traces, spans and logs5.</description></item><item><title>Splunk APM</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v4.89/en/apm/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v4.89/en/apm/index.html</guid><description>Splunk APM is a NoSample™ Full-fidelity application performance monitoring and troubleshooting solution for cloud-native, microservices-based applications.
By collecting all traces, instead of a sampled subset, no anomaly goes undetected. Whether a user experiences an error or longer-than-usual latency, you’ll be able to know and act on it within seconds. Furthermore, not all bad behavior results in errors — as your developers create new applications they need to know whether their canary releases provide the expected results.</description></item><item><title>Splunk RUM</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v4.89/en/rum/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v4.89/en/rum/index.html</guid><description>Splunk RUM is the industry’s only end to end, full fidelity Real User Monitoring solution.

Once you have access to each platform, keep them open for the duration of the workshop as you will be switching between them and the workshop instructions.
1. Activate your Splunk On-Call Login You should have received an invitation to Activate your Splunk On-Call account via e-mail, if you have not already done so, click the Activate Account link and follow the prompts.</description></item><item><title>.conf Workshops</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v4.89/en/conf/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v4.89/en/conf/index.html</guid><description>Newbie to Ninja - OpenTelemetry CollectorThis workshop will equip you with the basic understanding of monitoring Kubernetes using the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector</description></item><item><title>Other Workshops</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v4.89/en/other/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v4.89/en/other/index.html</guid><description>Observability 4 RookiesThis workshop will equip you with the basic understanding of monitoring Kubernetes using the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector
