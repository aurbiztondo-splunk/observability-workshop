Downloading the OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib distribution The first step in installing the Open Telemetry Collector is downloading it. For our lab we will use the &amp;lsquo;wget&amp;rsquo; command to download the &amp;lsquo;.deb&amp;rsquo; package from the OpenTelemetry Github repository.
Obtain the .deb package for your platform from the OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib releases page
wget https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases/download/v0.75.0/otelcol-contrib_0.75.0_linux_amd64.deb ðŸ¥· Ninja: Build your own collector using Open Telemetry Collector Builder (ocb) For this part we will require the following installed on your system:</description></item><item><title>OpenTelemetry Collector Extensions</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v4.88/en/conf/opentelemetry-collector/2-extensions/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v4.88/en/conf/opentelemetry-collector/2-extensions/index.html</guid><description>Now that we have the OpenTelemetry Collector is installed. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at extensions for the OTEL Collector.
Extensions are available primarily for tasks that do not involve processing telemetry data. Examples of extensions include health monitoring, service discovery, and data forwarding. Extensions are optional.
Extensions are configured in the same config.yaml file that we reference in module 1 of this lab. Let&amp;rsquo;s edit the config.yaml file and configure the extensions.</description></item><item><title>OpenTelemetry Collector Receivers</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v4.88/en/conf/opentelemetry-collector/3-receivers/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v4.88/en/conf/opentelemetry-collector/3-receivers/index.html</guid><description>Welcome to the receiver portion of the workshop! This is the starting point of the data pipeline of the OpenTelemetry Collector. Let&amp;rsquo;s dive in.
A receiver, which can be push or pull based, is how data gets into the Collector. Receivers may support one or more data sources. Generally, a receiver accepts data in a specified format, translates it into the internal format and passes it to processors and exporters defined in the applicable pipelines.</description></item><item><title>OpenTelemetry Collector Processors</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v4.88/en/conf/opentelemetry-collector/4-processors/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v4.88/en/conf/opentelemetry-collector/4-processors/index.html</guid><description>Processors are run on data between being received and being exported. Processors are optional though some are recommended. There are a large number of processors included in the OpenTelemetry contrib Collector.
Batch Processor By default, only the batch processor is enabled. This processor is used to batch up data before it is exported. This is useful for reducing the number of network calls made to exporters. For this workshop we will accept the defaults (send_batch_size: 8192, timeout: 200ms, send_batch_size_max: 0).</description></item><item><title>OpenTelemetry Collector Exporters</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v4.88/en/conf/opentelemetry-collector/5-exporters/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v4.88/en/conf/opentelemetry-collector/5-exporters/index.html</guid><description>An exporter, which can be push or pull based, is how you send data to one or more backends/destinations. Exporters may support one or more data sources.

If a component is configured, but not defined within the service section then it is not enabled. The service section consists of three sub-sections:
extensions pipelines telemetry In the default configuration the extension section has been configured to enable health_check, pprof and zpages which we configured in the Extensions module earlier.</description></item><item><title>Data Visualisations</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v4.88/en/conf/opentelemetry-collector/7-visualisation/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v4.88/en/conf/opentelemetry-collector/7-visualisation/index.html</guid><description> Attachments dashboard_OTel-Contrib-Dashboard.json (37 KB)</description></item></channel></rss>
