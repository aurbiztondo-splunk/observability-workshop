## 1. Check your EC2 server

This workshop module assumes you are completing this after you have run the IM workshop, and still have access to your EC2 instance.

If this is the case, continue with [Deploy Online Boutique](#2-deploy-online-boutique), otherwise if you have received a fresh instance, please run the first two (2) sections of [Deploy the OTel Collector](../../imt/gdi/) to get the system ready for the APM workshop, then continue with the next section.

## 2. Deploy Online Boutique

To deploy the Online Boutique application into K3s, run the `apm-config.sh` script, then apply the deployment:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab title="Deploy Online Boutique" %}}

``` bash
cd ~/workshop/apm
./apm-config.sh
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

{{% /tab %}}

## Validate Online Boutique is deployed

In the Splunk UI click on **Infrastructure** this will bring you to the Infrastructure Overview dashboard, then click on **Kubernetes**.

Use the **Cluster** dropdown to select the cluster name, you will see the new pods started and containers deployed. When you click on your Cluster in the Splunk UI you should have a view that looks like below:

![Back to cluster](../images/online-boutique-k8s.png)

If you select the **WORKLOADS** tab again you should now see that there are a number of Deployments and ReplicaSets:

## Visit the Online Boutique

{{% expand title="{{% badge style=primary icon=user-ninja %}}**Ninja** - Visit the Online Boutique you just deployed{{% /badge %}}" %}}
{{% notice style="blue" %}}
The Online Boutique is viewable on port 81 of the EC2 instance's IP address. The IP address is the one you used to SSH into the instance at the beginning of the workshop.

Open your web browser and go to `http://<ec2-ip-address>:81/` where you will then be able to see the Online Boutique running.
