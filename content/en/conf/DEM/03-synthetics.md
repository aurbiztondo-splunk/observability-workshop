We can see how RUM helpfully captures what end users are experiencing. What's a drawback to only using RUM?

Let's look at a Synthetic test. What is it capturing? 

Now let's create some Synthetic tests on the same site.

1. Go to Synthetics in Observability
1. Click "Add new > Browser Test"
1. Name the test with three initials that identify you and high level info about the test
   1. For example, "SEW Home Desktop US" 
1. Enter the URL, locations, device type, frequency, and **Save**. We'll wait a few minutes while data is being gathered.
1. What do you see in Synthetics? How might this testing be beneficial? Does this spark ideas for more testing?
1. Click on a run result and see the relevant RUM data in the right sidebar.
   1. How does the Synthetics data compare to RUM?
   1. When could comparing Synthetics results to RUM data be helpful?
1. Now we'll make changes to our site configuration... what changes do you see in the data?
