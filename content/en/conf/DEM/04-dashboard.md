Go to x dashboard.

Click the three dots on the top right and click "Save As"

Name the Dashboard starting with your three intitials, e.g. "SEW Digital Experience"

Save to your dashboard group.

Change the filter to include tests with your initials "test=SEW*"

Open the table chart to see how this was made, and feel free to add/remove other tests and metrics as you'd like.

## Compare to other websites
Create one or more Synthetic Browser Tests on your competitors' websites, with your initials in the title of the tests. If you want to make multiple tests with the same configuration, use the "copy" feature.

Look at the results in this competitive table view. 

{{% notice title="Tip on comparing metrics" style="info" %}}
Make sure you're comparing apples to apples whenever possible. For example, if you want to see how your homepage compares to your competitors, make sure to not only have all tests on homepages, but also make sure the connection speed, device type, and locations are the same - because these are variables that change performance.

One way to do this is to **copy** an existing test with the configuration you want, rename the test, and update the URL.
{{% /notice %}}

How does your performance compare?
