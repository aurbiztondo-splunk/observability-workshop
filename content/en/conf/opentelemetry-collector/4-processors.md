[Processors](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/processor/README.md) are run on data between being received and being exported. Processors are optional though some are recommended. There are [a large number of processors](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/processor) included in the OpenTelemetry contrib Collector.

## Batch Processor

By default, only the **batch** processor is enabled. This processor is used to batch up data before it is exported. This is useful for reducing the number of network calls made to exporters. For this workshop we will accept the defaults (`send_batch_size: 8192`, `timeout: 200ms`, `send_batch_size_max: 0`).

## Resource Detection Processor

The resource detection processor can be used to detect resource information from the host and append or override the resource value in telemetry data with this information.

By default, the hostname is set to the FQDN if possible, otherwise the hostname provided by the OS is used as a fallback. This logic can be changed from using using the `hostname_sources` configuration option. To avoid getting the FQDN and use the hostname provided by the OS, we will set the `hostname_sources` to `os`.

## Attributes Processor

The attributes processor modifies attributes of a span, log, or metric. This processor also supports the ability to filter and match input data to determine if they should be included or excluded for specified actions.

It takes a list of actions which are performed in order specified in the config. The supported actions are:

* `insert`: Inserts a new attribute in input data where the key does not already exist.
* `update`: Updates an attribute in input data where the key does exist.
* `upsert`: Performs insert or update. Inserts a new attribute in input data where the key does not already exist and updates an attribute in input data where the key does exist.
* `delete`: Deletes an attribute from the input data.
* `hash`: Hashes (SHA1) an existing attribute value.
* `extract`: Extracts values using a regular expression rule from the input key to target keys specified in the rule. If a target key already exists, it will be overridden.

We are going to create an attributes processor to `insert` a new attribute to all our host metrics called `conf.attendee.name` with a value of your own name e.g. `rcastley`.

Later on in the workshop we will use this attribute to filter our metrics in Splunk Observability Cloud.
