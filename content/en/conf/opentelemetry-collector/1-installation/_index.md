## Download the OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib distribution

The first step in installing the Open Telemetry Collector is downloading it. For our lab we will use the `wget` command to download the `.deb` package from the OpenTelemetry Github repository.

Obtain the `.deb` package for your platform from the [OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib releases page](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases)

``` bash
wget https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases/download/v0.80.0/otelcol-contrib_0.80.0_linux_amd64.deb
```

## Install the OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib distribution

Install the `.deb` package using `dpkg`. Take a look at the **dpkg Output** tab below to see what the example output of a successful install will look like:
