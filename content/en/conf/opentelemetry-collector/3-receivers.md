Welcome to the receiver portion of the workshop! This is the starting point of the data pipeline of the OpenTelemetry Collector. Let's dive in.

A receiver, which can be push or pull based, is how data gets into the Collector. Receivers may support one or more data sources. Generally, a receiver accepts data in a specified format, translates it into the internal format and passes it to processors and exporters defined in the applicable pipelines.

### Host Metrics Receiver

[The Host Metrics Receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/hostmetricsreceiver/README.md) generates metrics about the host system scraped from various sources. This is intended to be used when the collector is deployed as an agent which is what we will be doing in this workshop.

Let's edit our `/etc/otelcontribcol/config.yaml` file and configure the hostmetrics receiver. Insert the following YAML under the **receivers** section, taking care to indent by two spaces e.g.

``` bash
sudo vi /etc/otelcontribcol/config.yaml
```

{{< tabs >}}

You will also notice another receiver called `prometheus`. [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/) is an open-source toolkit used by the OpenTelemetry Collector. This receiver is used to scrape metrics from the OpenTelemetry Collector itself. These metrics can then be used to monitor the health of the collector.

Let's modify the `prometheus` receiver to clearly show that it is for collecting metrics from the collector itself. By changing the name of the receiver from `prometheus` to `prometheus/internal`, it is now much clearer as to what that receiever is doing. Edit the `/etc/otelcontribcol/config.yaml` file to look like this:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab title="Prometheus Receiver Configuration" %}}

```yaml {hl_lines=[1]}
prometheus/internal:
  config:
    scrape_configs:
    - job_name: 'otel-collector'
      scrape_interval: 10s
      static_configs:
      - targets: ['0.0.0.0:8888']
```

## Example Dashboard - Prometheus metrics

The following screenshot shows an example dashboard of the metrics the Prometheus internal receiver collects from the OpenTelemetry Collector. Here, we can see accepted and sent spans, metrics and log records.

## Other Receivers

You will notice in the default configuration there are other receivers (`otlp`, `opencensus`, `jaeger` and `zipkin`). These are used to receive telemetry data from other sources. We will not be using these receivers in this workshop and can be left as they are.

Now that we have reviewed how data gets into the OTEL Collector, we can now learn how the Collector processes the data.
