## Building The Configuration

The configuration portion of the component is how the user is able to have their inputs over the component,
so the values that is used for the configuration need to be:

1. Intuative for users to understand what that field controls
1. Be explict in what is required and what is optional
1. Reuse common names and fields
1. Keep the options simple

The bad configuration highlights how doing the opposite of the recomendations of configuration practices impacts the usability
of the component. It doesn't make it clear what field values should be, it includes features that can be pushed to existing processors,
and the field naming is not consistent with other components that exist in the collector.

The good configuration keeps the required values simple, reuses field names from other components, and ensures the component focuses on
just the interaction between Jenkins and the collector.

The code tab shows how much is required to be added by us and what is already provided for us by shared libraries within the collector.
These will be explained in more detail once we get to the business logic. The configuration should start off small and will change
once the business logic has started to include additional features that is needed.
