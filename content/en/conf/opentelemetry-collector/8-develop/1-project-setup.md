To get started developing a the new _Jenkins CI_ receiver, we first need to set up a Golang project.
The steps to create your new Golang project is:

1. Create a new directoy named `${HOME}/go/src/jenkinscireceiver` and change into it
    1. The actual directory name or location is not strict, you can choose your own development directory to make it in.
1. Initialise the golang module by going `go mod init splunk.conf/workshop/example/jenkinscireceiver`
    1. This will create a file named `go.mod` which is used to track our direct and indirect dependencies
    1. Eventually there will be a `go.sum` which is the checksum values of the depedancies being imported.
