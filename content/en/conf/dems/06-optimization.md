Now that we've seen both real user and synthetic performance information -- how do we actually make improvements?

Go to [this will be a link] optimization.rigor.com. This is an optimization scan on our own splunk.com website.

Here we see some website scans that are capturing performance data as well as some web best practices to improve. Follow along as we take a tour.

Click the "i" icon on the top right to see how the test was configured. Similar to our Synthetic Browser Tests, right?

Take a look at these items in particular:

1. How does your content size compare to the internet average?
1. Do you have an expected amount of third-party content compared to your first-party content?
1. What's the most severe "defect" listed for a particular resource?
1. Under "Top Performance Defects" click "View All" to go to the best practices. Do you see any themes?
1. In the list of defects, sort by highest number of related Links -- what stands out?
1. Is there anything you know you don't care about? If so, mute it!
1. Scroll to the top of the Snapshot and click "Test Again" -- how does the new Snapshot compare to the older one?

There's a lot here, but what's important is that you now have a starting point to improving performance.
