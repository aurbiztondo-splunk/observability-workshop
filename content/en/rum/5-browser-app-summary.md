## 1. Application Summary Dashboard Overview

### 1.1. Header Bar

As seen in the previous section the RUM Application Summary Dashboard consists of 5 major sections.</br>
The first section is the selection header, where you can collapse the Pane via the ![RUM-browser](../images/browser.png?classes=inline&height=25px) Browser icon or the **>** in front of the application name, which is *jmcj-rum-app* in the example below. It also provides access to the *Application Overview* page if you click the link with your application name which is *jmcj-rum-app* in the example below.

Further, you can also open the *Application Overview*  or *App Health Dashboard* via the triple dot ![trippleburger](../images/trippleburger.png?classes=inline&height=25px) menu on the right.

![RUM-SummaryHeader](../images/summaryHeader.png)

First use the *View Dashboard* link to open the Browser App Health Dashboard which should open in a new tab.  Then switch back to original RUM tab, and then use the *Open Application Overview* link, or click on the name of the app to launch the Application Overview dashboard.

We will looking at the *Application Overview* and *Browser App Health* Dashboards in detail in the following sections.

## 2. Application Overview

The RUM Application Overview Dashboard is focused on providing you with *at a glance* overview of the status of your application.

### 2.1. Page Views / Errors & Network Requests / Errors

The first section shows *Page Views / Errors*, & *Network Requests and Errors* charts show the quantity and trend of these issues in your application. This could be Javascript errors, or failed  network calls to back end services.

![RUM-chart](../images/Rum-chart.png)

In the example above you can see that there are no failed network calls in the Network chart, but in the Page View chart you can see that a number of pages do experience some errors. These are often not visible for regular users, but can seriously impact the performance of your web site.

You can see the count of the Page Views / Network Requests / Errors by hovering over the charts.

### 2.2. JavaScript Errors

With the second section of the RUM Application Summary Dashboard we are showing you an overview of the JavaScript errors occurring in your application, along with a count of each error.

![RUM-javascript](../images/RUM-Javascripterrors.png)

In the example above you can see there are three JavaScript errors, one that appears 29 times in the selected time slot, and the other two each appear 12 times.

If you click on one of the errors a pop-out opens that will show a summary (below) of the errors over time, along with a Stack Trace of the JavaScript error, giving you an indication of where the problems occurred. (We will see this in more detail in one of the following sections)

![RUM-javascript-chart](../images/expandedRUmJAVAscript-error.png)

### 2.3. Web Vitals

The third section of the RUM Application Summary Dashboard is showing you the crucial (google) Web Vitals, three metrics, that are used by Google in its ranking system, and give a very good indication of the speed  of your site for your end users.

![WEB-vitals](../images/RUM-QuickWebVitals.png)

As you can see our site is well behaved and scores *Good* for all three Metrics. These metrics can be used to identify the effect changes to your application have, and help you improve the performance of your site.

If you click on any of the Metrics shown in the Web Vitals pane you will be taken to the corresponding Tag Spotlight Dashboard.  e.g. clicking on the **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)** chartlet, you will be taken to a dashboard similar to the screen shot below, that gives you timeline and table views for how this metric has performed. This should allow you to spot trends and identify where the problem may be more common, such as an OS or browser version, .

### 2.4. Most Recent Detectors

The fourth and final section of the RUM Application Summary Dashboard is focused on providing you an overview of any detector that has triggered for your application. We have created a detector for this screen shot but your pane will be empty for now, but we will add some detectors to your site and make sure they are triggered in one of the next sections.

![detectors](../images/rum-detector.png)

In the screen shot you can see we have a critical alert for the *RUM Aggregated View Detector*,  and a Count, how often this alert has triggered in the selected time window. If you happen to have an alert listed, you can click on the name of the Alert (that is shown as a blue link) and you will be taken to the Alert Overview page showing the details of the alert (Note: this will move you away from the current page, Please use the **Back** option of your browser to return to the overview page).
