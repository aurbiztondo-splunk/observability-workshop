In this workshop, we will be focusing on using the OpenTelemetry collector and starting with the fundamentals of configuring the receivers, processors, and exporters ready to use with Splunk Cloud. The journey will take attendees from novices to being able to start adding custom components to help solve for their business observability needs for their distributed platform.</description></item></channel></rss>
